# NSIM

NSIM is simulating environment for NPC, which is based on NEMU framework. The design details you can find at [here](https://yewpo.top/153/).

## Usage

> Add `NSIM_HOME` to your `PATH` system variable.

NSIM has default image inside. You can run it by following command.

```shell
make run
```

You can generate a wave file by `make menuconfig` and select `wave trace` in `testing and tracing`. After you get a wave file generated by NSIM, you can watch it by following command. **Yet, you should install GTKwave first.**

```shell
make wv
```

NSIM can detect the changes of the C and CPP files in NSIM, but cannot detect the changes in you NPC! So, when you edited you NPC source files, you should first build NPC source codes at NPC work place, and then clean the NSIM work place before buliding NSIM.

Other usages is similar to the NEMU.
